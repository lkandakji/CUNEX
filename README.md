# CUNEX
CUNEX is a generalizable segmentation model based on the nnU-Net framework for full corneal segmentation from AS-OCT images, validated on healthy, keratoconus, Fuchs dystrophy and infectious kerititis eyes.
# System Requirements

# Data Prep
The only way to run inference with CUNEX is by storing it in the nnU-Net format. The dataset directory been set up for you. The nnuU-Net results folder is there and has the trained model. You must add a directory nnunet_raw/nnunet_raw_data where you will make directories for your dataset in the format Dataset0001_{name of dataset}. dataset.json file specifying some metadata.
