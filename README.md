# CUNEX
CUNEX is a generalizable segmentation model based on the nnU-Net framework for full corneal segmentation from AS-OCT images, validated on healthy, keratoconus, Fuchs dystrophy and infectious kerititis eyes.
# System Requirements

# Data Prep
The only way to run inference with CUNEX is by storing it in the nnU-Net format. The dataset directory set up has been done for you and consists of three components: raw images, model path, and a dataset.json file specifying some metadata.
